    <h1>EP 4 - Module export and require</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>require</h2>
      <p>
        We can require a module using require function. Require function is
        available in node js anywhere.
        <strong>
          Module protects thier variables and functions by default. We can
          export and import using the module variables and functions.
        </strong>
        We don't have to write file extension manually if the file is
        Javascript. There are two types of modules are followed.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Common JS Module</li>
        <li>EJS Module</li>
      </ol>
      <p>By default cjs is used in Node js</p>
      <h2>Common JS Module</h2>
      <p>
        We can use module.exports and require to export and import the variables
        and functions. This is older way of exporting and importing it. It is
        imported in synchronous way. Run in non strict mode.
      </p>
      <h2>ES Modules</h2>
      <p>
        Uses export and import syntax. Newer way of exporting and importing
        syntax and by default used by frameworks like React and Angular. It is
        imported in asynchronous way. Run in strict mode.
      </p>
    </section>
    <h3>Grouping module with related files</h3>
    <section>
      <p>
        We can group set of related files like sum, multiply into a folder as a
        module by having index file. We can import and export in index file and
        we don't even have to include index while requiring it. By default it
        will look into index.js file
      </p>
      <p>
        For json files we can directly require it. module.exports are not
        needed. Also node js provide many default built in modules.
        <strong
          >Module is basically a collection of javascript code which is private
          to itself. It exists seperately.</strong
