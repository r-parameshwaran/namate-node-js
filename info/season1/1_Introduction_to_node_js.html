      <h2>Javascript runtime</h2>
      <p>
        Node JS is a javascript runtime which is built on top of chrome v8
        engine. Node JS maintained by Open JS foundation. Node js helps us run
        JS outside the browser. Node JS have an event driven architecture and
        capable of
        <strong>
          asynchrous I/O. Asynchronous I/O is also known as non blocking I/O.
        </strong>
        Node JS is developed in 2009 by Ryan Dahl.

      <h2>Node JS History</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >To run JS you always need a JS engine. We can not run JS without JS
          engine. Wherever there is Javascript there will always be a JS
          engine.</strong
        >
        Every browser runs JS has thier own JS engine. The advantage of non
        blocking server is, it can handle multiple requests with less number of
        threads. In 2010 npm is created. It is a package manager for node
        maintaining the code. It is basically a registery a place where we save
        our code.
